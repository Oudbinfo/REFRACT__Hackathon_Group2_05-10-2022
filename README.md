# REFRACT__Hackathon_Group2_05-10-2022
Solution to the challenge given to the group 2 in REFRACT Hackathon event held in 05/10/2022

Group members:
Amilia Christina Vagiona (JGU), David Moyano Palazuelo (CSIC), 
Ian Czarnowski (UNQ), Rubiel Vargas-Canas (UNICAUCA), Soroush Mozaffari (UNIPD)

In this challenge, the group members were asked to generate
a dataset of Tandem Repeat proteins that bind either DNA or RNA.

While all the steps to the solution are described in detail in the associated JPN,
here is a short summary of the adopted approach:

1. Create a dataset of proteins that are annotated as TRP
2. Create a dataset of DNA biding proteins
3. Create a dataset of RNA binding proteins
4. Look for overlapping between the TRPs and DNA/RNA binding proteins
5. Visualize the obtained data


You can see the final results in ./data/output/ directory.
For more information, please check the Jupyter Notebook file.
